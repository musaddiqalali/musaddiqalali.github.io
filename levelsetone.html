								<p>Level set is utilizing the binarized design variables. Level set method is originated as a non-parametric methodology that implicitly represents shapes. It has been originated first by Dervieux and Thomasset as a method to study multiphase flow. Following, several papers that addressing fluid interface were taken a similar scheme of formulations. The term “Level set|” was not yet been introduced till the resuscitation of the method with much complex topological notations by Osher and Sethin. The method was intensively used in segmentation and object shape identification in computer vision. The advancement in computational power has eased the restriction of the computational memory’s lack, such that, as an implicit method, level set has the tendency in the time of its early introduction to consume large computational resources for that era. The advancement of computational power was behind the later introduction of level set method for computationally expensive problems as for stress minimization problem by Sethian and Wiegmann. This opened the door toward utilizing the method successfully in moderately computationally demanding problems as for minimizing structural strain energy. The level set method has been presented as a free of mesh independency problems such as checkboard and grayscale. However, as an evolution method, the function parameters are depending on the problem. In other words, it is important to select a suitable initial value of the function and the normal velocity update. Add to that evolution of boundaries might not be sensitive enough to the local solution within the optimization loop, therefore; local minima can be obtained due to the lack of the ability to create new boundaries inside the solid materials and far from the original boundaries. Several methodologies are addressing these issues such as topological derivative term and parametrizing the level set, as well as the use of regularized Heaviside function to prevent numerical instabilities and avoid singularity in conductivity matrix. such that, the Heaviside function which is taking the value of one when the level set function is positive or zero, and, here zero is representing the void areas.</p>
