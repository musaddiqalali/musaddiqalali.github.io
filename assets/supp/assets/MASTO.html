        <h1>Optimizing Heat Sinks with MASTO: A Multi-Objective Approach to Heat Dissipation and EMI</h1>
        <p>
            In this study, researchers introduced the Metaheuristic Aided Structural Topology Optimization (MASTO) method, leveraging the YUKI metaheuristic and Optimality Criteria (OC) for optimizing heat sink design in multiphysics applications. This approach addresses the dual challenges of thermal dissipation and electromagnetic interference (EMI) reduction, critical in electronics. By using YUKI to define and refine initial domains, MASTO identifies configurations that effectively balance heat transfer with minimal EMI.
        </p>
        <h2>Methodology and Novel Contributions</h2>
        <p>
            The MASTO framework utilizes a two-level optimization. The YUKI algorithm assesses initial layouts for thermal and electromagnetic efficiency, refining starting points for topology optimization with OC. This contrasts traditional single-point methods by embracing the inherent dependency on initial conditions within non-parametric optimizations. The research thus frames initial domain dependency not as a limitation but as an asset, enriching the search for optimal solutions in complex scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mathematical modeling includes considerations for heat dissipation via convection, compliance minimization, and VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio) for EMI control. The 2D topology optimization approach here applies triangular mesh elements for electromagnetic simulations and structured rectangular mesh for heat simulations, with binary element states (solid or void) guiding material allocation.
        </p>
        <h2>Experimental and Numerical Validation</h2>
        <p>
            For validation, designs with varying fin configurations—such as 14, 10, and 6-line layouts—underwent computational and experimental testing. Notably, a 6-line configuration achieved exceptional thermal distribution and minimized radiative emissions, as demonstrated by high VSWR values. Thermal imaging further confirmed that the 6-line design performed best in managing temperature distribution across the sink, pointing to enhanced thermal dissipation.
        </p>
        <h2>Results and Implications</h2>
        <p>
            The study's experimental and theoretical agreement reinforces MASTO's robustness and applicability for real-world multiphysics optimization, providing a promising methodology for electronic cooling applications where both thermal and electromagnetic performance are critical. This work exemplifies how metaheuristics in initial domain configurations can greatly enhance structural optimization, yielding solutions that would be infeasible with traditional methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            MASTO thus bridges topology optimization with innovative, practical applications, opening doors for more efficient, EMI-sensitive designs in advanced electronics.
